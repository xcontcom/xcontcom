# 👋 Hi, I'm Serhii — aka [xcont](https://xcont.com)

I'm a self-taught developer working at the intersection of optimization, pattern formation, and cellular automata.  
I build experimental systems where complexity emerges from simple rules — using code, recursion, and a bit of stubbornness.

## 🧬 Core Projects

### 🔁 Evolving Cellular Automata — Rule-Based Evolution

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/initial-state-evolution/blob/main/screenshots/preview.png" width="400" alt="Initial State Evolution preview" />

Genetic algorithm that evolves cellular automaton rules to maximize specific behavior (like flickering, stability, or growth).

### 🧠 Evolving Initial States — Field-Based Optimization  

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/evolving-cellular-automata/blob/main/docs/images/19.gif" width="400" alt="Evolving Cellular Automata preview" />

A genetic algorithm evolves the *initial field state* of a cellular automaton while keeping the rules fixed.  
The goal: observe what kinds of behavior or structures can *emerge* from a Turing-complete substrate.  
It’s a search for dynamics, complexity, or stability — without touching the rules themselves.

### 🧩 Recursive Fractal Generator + GA

Fractal patterns generated via recursive substitution, then evolved using a genetic algorithm.  
Focus: visual symmetry, self-similarity, and how simple logic creates structured complexity.

## 🧠 Interests

- Emergence, recursion, and transformation
- Genetic algorithms and search-space exploration
- Cellular automata as minimal computational universes
- Visual representations of abstract systems
- Metaphysical math (no mysticism — just weird consequences of logic)
