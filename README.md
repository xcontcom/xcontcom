# 👋 Hi, I'm Serhii — aka [xcont](https://xcont.com)

I'm a self-taught developer working at the intersection of optimization, pattern formation, and cellular automata.  
I build experimental systems where complexity emerges from simple rules — using code, recursion, and a bit of stubbornness.

## 🧬 Core Projects

### 🔁 Evolving Cellular Automata — Rule-Based Evolution

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/evolving-cellular-automata/blob/main/docs/images/19.gif" alt="Evolving Cellular Automata preview" />

Genetic algorithm that evolves cellular automaton rules to maximize specific behavior (like flickering, stability, or growth).

### 🧠 Evolving Initial States — Field-Based Optimization

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/initial-state-evolution/blob/main/screenshots/preview.png" alt="Initial State Evolution preview" />

A genetic algorithm evolves the *initial field state* of a cellular automaton while keeping the rules fixed.  
The goal: observe what kinds of behavior or structures can *emerge* from a Turing-complete substrate.  
It’s a search for dynamics, complexity, or stability — without touching the rules themselves.

### 🧩 Recursive Fractal Generator + GA

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/fractals/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif" alt="Fractal Generator preview" />

Fractal patterns generated via recursive substitution, then evolved using a genetic algorithm.  
Focus: visual symmetry, self-similarity, and how simple logic creates structured complexity.

### 🌀 Fractogenesis: CA vs Conv

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/fractogenesis/blob/main/images/2dconv5.png" alt="Fractogenesis preview" width="400" />

Fractals from a single point — grown using either cellular automata or convolution kernels.
This project explores 6 minimal systems that all follow the same basic idea:
Start with a tiny seed, apply a deterministic transformation, pad or copy, repeat. Fractals emerge.

But here’s the twist — CNNs (convolutional neural nets) do the same. They copy, convolve, repeat.
So what happens when we apply the same kernel over each iteration? You get... fractals.
Turns out, when a neural net "draws a cat", it draws a fractal that looks like a cat.

### 🧮 Perfect Shuffle Fractals — Recursive Spatial Permutation

<img src="https://github.com/xcontcom/perfect-shuffle/blob/main/docs/images/preview.png" alt="Perfect Shuffle Fractals preview" width="400" />

Fractals generated by recursively permuting pixel arrays via a quadrant-based shuffle operation.  
This deterministic process reveals deep structural symmetries in both binary and full-color images.

The method echoes spatial structure-modification routines found in convolutional architectures (e.g., padding and upsampling),  
though it diverges from convolution by applying no local aggregation — only recursive, deterministic reordering.
